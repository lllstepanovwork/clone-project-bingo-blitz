🎱 Bingo Blitz Clone — Unity Project

A personal educational project inspired by the charm and simplicity of Bingo Blitz by Playtika.
I’ve always admired how such a simple core idea can evolve into a captivating experience through delightful animations, satisfying effects, and a vibrant art style.
This project is my attempt to study those elements firsthand while improving my skills in Unity development, game architecture, and mobile workflows.
